# DataCo-Global-Analysis

## Introduction

Data is increasingly important in business today. In business generally  data has become vital for a company’s performance to enable data driven decisions.

This project explores into company performances,  evaluating a large data collection to uncover significant insights that lead to more effective operations and data-driven strategic decisions. Personally, the goal of this research is to improve my practical knowledge while also practicing skills in data investigation, problem solving, and analytical thinking.

## Problem Statement

Recently, the company's sales have exhibited an alarming trend in which sales values have been declining while the quantity of orders submitted has been increasing. Our goal is to do a comprehensive data analysis focused on sales, and order KPIs in order to address this issue and make informed business decisions. We intend to discover the underlying causes of decreased sales despite higher orders and deliver actionable insights to optimize our operations, pricing strategies, and customer engagement, with the ultimate goal of increasing overall profitability.


### User Persona

In this Project, I create dashboard/reports to help “Manager” perform their task efficiently.

## Analysis & Insights

In this analysis, I will be focusing on the last year performance which is 2017.

****************************Sales and Order Performance****************************

In 2017, sales were marginally lower than the previous year. On the average, the few last  month of the year indicate a considerable drop in sales from the previous month. In contrast, the number of orders placed in the last several months has climbed. The decrease in sales in 2017 is due to decreasing demand for certain "expensive" products that contribute considerably to company's sales. According to the reason why the total order has risen, the company has acquired more customers in the same period of time who order new products that are comparably cheaper in price.


******Completion Rate******
Let’s take a look at order complete rate in the selected year.

The overall order completion rate was ~32 %, as indicated above, which demands additional improvement because the higher the complete rate, the better.

After drilling down further to order status tracking, it is clear why the completion rate was so low. As illustrated in the figure above, this is due to bottlenecks and inefficiencies in each level. To address those problems, the manager have to cooperate with the supply chain department to determine where interventions are needed to streamline the process and reduce order processing times.

## Recommendations

- To increase the sales, the company can introduce the bundling program or offer the promotion program.
- To improve the completion rate the stakeholders should cooperate closely with logistic department to intervene the bottlenecks of processing.
